         <h2>Health</h2>
         <p>Health' is a state of complete physical, social and mental well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Health is thus a level
            of functional efficiency of living beings and a gene
           ral condition of a persons mind, body and spirit, meaning it is free from illness, injury and pain. It is a resource of everyday life and a posi
           tive concept emphasizing physical capabilities.</p>
           <p>Good health is a secret of every happy man. There is an old saying, 'Health is Wealth'. Staying healthy for children is vital for proper growt
             h and development of mind and body as they need to focus in the class and fully participate in the activities on the field. Parents must take t

             heir children for medical check-up and learn from experts about their development in terms of height and weight, as it has a huge impact on the
             ir overall performance and efficiency. If you are strong and healthy, you can be a shining example to others and teach them how to achieve vibr
             ant health.</p>

         <h2>what is covid-19?</h2>
         <p>COVID-19 is a disease caused by
           the “novel corona virus”. Common
           symptoms are:<br>
            Fever
            Dry cough
            Breathing difficulty
            Some patients also have aches and pains,
           nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or

           diarrhoea</p>
           <p>
             About 80% of confirmed cases recover from the disease
             without any serious complications. However, one out
             of every six people who gets COVID-19 can become
             seriously ill and develop difficulty in breathing. In more
             severe cases, infection can cause severe pneumonia
             and other complications which can be treated only at
             higher level facilities (District Hospitals and above). In a
             few cases it may even cause death.</p>

         <h2>mental health</h2>
         <p>Mental health is not just a concept that refers to an individual’s psychological and emotional well being. Rather it’s a state of p
           sychological and emotional well being where an individual is able to use their cognitive and emotional capabilities, meet the ordin
           ary demand and functions in the society. According to WHO, there is no single ‘official’ definition of mental health.</p>

         <p>Thus, there are many factors like cultural differences, competing professional theories, and subjective assessments that affect
            how mental health is defined. Also, there are many experts that agree that mental illness and mental health are not antonyms. S
            o, in other words, when the recognized mental disorder is absent, it is not necessarily a sign of mental health.</p>

         <h2>STRESS reduction</h2>
         <p>This research highlights the effects of stress at work place, and on personal healthy. There are three indicators for stress they
            are; emotional, and physical. Stress in general is not hazardous, but if it continues for a long time it become chronic, and may
             affect person’s life. Therefore I am going to present three ways to cope with stress they are: medication, meditation, and rela
             xation. Meditation and relaxation are two safe ways unlike medication which contain some kind of drugs and it have many side ef
             fects. Finally I will give some hints to reduce stress at work socially.</p>
